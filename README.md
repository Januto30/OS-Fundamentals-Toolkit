# Operative Systems

This repository contains projects and exercises focused on the fundamental concepts of operating systems. It serves as a hands-on exploration of how operating systems manage resources, processes, and communication in a computer system.

### Key Features:
- Implementation of process scheduling and management techniques.
- Exploration of synchronization mechanisms (e.g., semaphores, mutexes).
- Practical examples of memory management and file systems.
- Hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts.
